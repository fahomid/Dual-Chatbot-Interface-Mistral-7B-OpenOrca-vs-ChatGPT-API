Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column does not equal a certain value.," To retrieve records where a specific column does not equal a certain value, you can use the NOT IN or NOT EXISTS clause in SQL. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name NOT IN (value);
```

Replace ""table_name"" with the name of your table, ""column_name"" with the name of the column you want to check, and ""value"" with the value you want to compare against.

For example, if you have a table called ""users"" with a column called ""role"" and you want to retrieve all users who have a role that is not equal to ""admin"", you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE role NOT IN ('admin');
```

If you want to check for multiple values, you can use the IN clause with the NOT keyword:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name NOT IN (value1, value2,...);
```

For example, if you want to retrieve all users who have a role that is not equal to ""admin"" or ""moderator"", you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE role NOT IN ('admin','moderator');
```

Alternatively, you can use the NOT EXISTS clause:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name AS t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM table_name AS t2
    WHERE t1.column_name = t2.column_name AND t2.column_name = value
);
```

Replace ""table_name"" with the name of your table, ""column_name"" with the name of the column you want to check, and ""value"" with the value you want to compare against.

For example, if you want to retrieve all users who have a role that is not equal to ""admin"", you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users AS t1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM users AS t2
    WHERE t1.role = t2.role AND t2.role = 'admin'
);
```

Both methods will give you the same result, but the NOT IN clause is generally faster and more efficient.","Sure, here is an example SQL query that retrieves records where the ""column_name"" does not equal a certain value ""specific_value"":

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name <> 'specific_value';
``` 

In this query, replace ""table_name"" with the name of your table, ""column_name"" with the name of the specific column you want to check, and 'specific_value' with the value you want to exclude from the results."
