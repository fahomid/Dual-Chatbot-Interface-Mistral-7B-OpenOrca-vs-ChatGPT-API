Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column matches a pattern (using LIKE operator).," To retrieve records where a specific column matches a pattern using the LIKE operator, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE '%pattern%';
```

Replace 'column_name' with the name of the column you want to search, 'table_name' with the name of the table containing the column, and 'pattern' with the pattern you want to match. The '%' symbol is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column (column_name) matches a pattern 'pattern':

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE '%pattern%';
```

In this query:
- `table_name` is the name of the table you want to query.
- `column_name` is the name of the column you want to search for a pattern match.
- `pattern` is the specific pattern you want to match in the column's values.

The `%` symbols are wildcards that represent zero, one, or multiple characters. So, `%pattern%` means the pattern can occur anywhere in the column's value. You can adjust the `%` symbols to match your specific pattern matching needs."
