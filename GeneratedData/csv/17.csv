Give me SQL query to retrieve records from a table based on a subquery.," To retrieve records from a table based on a subquery, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE condition = (
    SELECT subquery_result
    FROM subquery_table
    WHERE subquery_condition
)
```

Replace ""table_name"" with the actual table name, ""column_names"" with the desired columns, ""condition"" with the comparison operator (e.g., =, <>, >, <, etc.), and ""subquery_table"" and ""subquery_condition"" with the appropriate subquery and conditions.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records from a table based on a subquery:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id 
                        FROM departments 
                        WHERE location = 'New York');
```

In this query, we are retrieving all records from the `employees` table where the `department_id` matches any `department_id` from the `departments` table that has a `location` value of 'New York'."
