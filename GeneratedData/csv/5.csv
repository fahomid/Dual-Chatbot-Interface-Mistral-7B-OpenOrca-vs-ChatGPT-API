Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column is less than a certain value.," To retrieve records where a specific column is less than a certain value, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name < value;
```

Replace ""table_name"" with the name of your table, ""column_name"" with the name of the column you want to compare, and ""value"" with the value you want to compare against.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column ""age"" is less than a certain value, let's say 30:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM your_table_name
WHERE age < 30;
```

Replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table and `age` with the column you want to filter by. This query will return all records where the value in the ""age"" column is less than 30."
