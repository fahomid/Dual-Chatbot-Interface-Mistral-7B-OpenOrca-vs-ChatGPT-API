"Give me SQL query to retrieve records grouped by a specific column with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc."," To retrieve records grouped by a specific column with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., you can use the following SQL query template:

```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

Replace ""column_name"" with the name of the column you want to group by, and ""aggregate_function"" with the desired aggregate function (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.). Replace ""table_name"" with the name of the table containing the data.

For example, if you want to count the number of records grouped by a specific column named ""category"" from a table named ""products"", the query would be:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

This query will return a result set with the category and the count of records for each category.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records grouped by a specific column with aggregate functions:

```
SELECT column_name1, COUNT(column_name2) AS count_column_name2, SUM(column_name3) AS sum_column_name3, AVG(column_name4) AS avg_column_name4
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name1;
```

In this query:
- `column_name1` is the column you want to group by.
- `column_name2` is the column you want to count.
- `column_name3` is the column you want to sum.
- `column_name4` is the column you want to calculate the average.
- `table_name` is the name of the table where the columns are located."
