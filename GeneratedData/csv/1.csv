Give me SQL query to retrieve all records from a specific table.," To retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN operations, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column3, table3.column4
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2
JOIN table3 ON table2.column3 = table3.column4;
```

Replace ""table1"", ""table2"", and ""table3"" with the actual table names, and ""column1"", ""column2"", ""column3"", and ""column4"" with the actual column names in each table. This query will join the records from the three tables based on the specified conditions.","Sure! Here is the SQL query to retrieve all records from a specific table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table from which you want to retrieve all records. This query will return all columns and rows from the specified table."
