Give me SQL query to retrieve a limited number of records using the LIMIT clause.," To retrieve a limited number of records using the LIMIT clause, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
LIMIT start_index, number_of_records;
```

Replace ""column_names"" with the columns you want to retrieve, ""table_name"" with the table name, ""start_index"" with the index of the first record you want to retrieve, and ""number_of_records"" with the number of records you want to retrieve.

For example, to retrieve the first 10 records from the ""users"" table, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 0, 10;
```

In this example, the ""0"" represents the start index (first record), and ""10"" represents the number of records to retrieve.","Sure! Here is an example of an SQL query that retrieves the first 10 records from a table called 'customers':

```
SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 10;
``` 

This query will return only the first 10 records from the 'customers' table."
