Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column equals a certain value.," To retrieve records where a specific column equals a certain value, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = value;
```

Replace ""column_name"" with the actual column name you want to retrieve, ""table_name"" with the table name, and ""value"" with the specific value you are looking for.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column (column_name) equals a certain value (desired_value):

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = 'desired_value';
```

In this query:
- `SELECT *` selects all columns from the table.
- `FROM table_name` specifies the table from which to retrieve records.
- `WHERE column_name = 'desired_value'` filters the records to only those where the column_name equals the desired_value.

You can replace `table_name`, `column_name`, and `desired_value` with your actual table name, column name, and desired value."
