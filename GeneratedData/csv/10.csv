Give me SQL query to retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN operations.," To retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN operations, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column3, table3.column4
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2
JOIN table3 ON table2.column3 = table3.column4;
```

Replace ""table1"", ""table2"", and ""table3"" with the actual table names, and ""column1"", ""column2"", ""column3"", and ""column4"" with the actual column names in each table. This query will join the records from the three tables based on the specified conditions.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query that retrieves records from multiple tables using JOIN operations:

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, products.product_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
JOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
JOIN products ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id;
```

This query retrieves the order ID, customer name, and product name for each order by joining the orders, customers, order_details, and products tables together based on their respective foreign keys."
