Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column is greater than a certain value.," To retrieve records where a specific column is greater than a certain value, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name > value;
```

Replace ""table_name"" with the name of your table, ""column_name"" with the name of the column you want to compare, and ""value"" with the value you want to compare against.","Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column `column_name` is greater than a certain value `value`:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name > value;
```

Replace `table_name`, `column_name`, and `value` with your actual table name, column name, and value that you want to compare against."
