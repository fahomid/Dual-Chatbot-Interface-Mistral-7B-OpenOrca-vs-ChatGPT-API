{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve a limited number of records using the LIMIT clause."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve a limited number of records using the LIMIT clause, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_names\nFROM table_name\nLIMIT start_index, number_of_records;\n```\n\nReplace \"column_names\" with the columns you want to retrieve, \"table_name\" with the table name, \"start_index\" with the index of the first record you want to retrieve, and \"number_of_records\" with the number of records you want to retrieve.\n\nFor example, to retrieve the first 10 records from the \"users\" table, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nLIMIT 0, 10;\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"0\" represents the start index (first record), and \"10\" represents the number of records to retrieve."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example of an SQL query that retrieves the first 10 records from a table called 'customers':\n\n```\nSELECT * \nFROM customers\nLIMIT 10;\n``` \n\nThis query will return only the first 10 records from the 'customers' table."}}
