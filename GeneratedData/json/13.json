{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records grouped by a specific column with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records grouped by a specific column with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., you can use the following SQL query template:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column_name;\n```\n\nReplace \"column_name\" with the name of the column you want to group by, and \"aggregate_function\" with the desired aggregate function (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.). Replace \"table_name\" with the name of the table containing the data.\n\nFor example, if you want to count the number of records grouped by a specific column named \"category\" from a table named \"products\", the query would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT category, COUNT(*)\nFROM products\nGROUP BY category;\n```\n\nThis query will return a result set with the category and the count of records for each category."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records grouped by a specific column with aggregate functions:\n\n```\nSELECT column_name1, COUNT(column_name2) AS count_column_name2, SUM(column_name3) AS sum_column_name3, AVG(column_name4) AS avg_column_name4\nFROM table_name\nGROUP BY column_name1;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `column_name1` is the column you want to group by.\n- `column_name2` is the column you want to count.\n- `column_name3` is the column you want to sum.\n- `column_name4` is the column you want to calculate the average.\n- `table_name` is the name of the table where the columns are located."}}
