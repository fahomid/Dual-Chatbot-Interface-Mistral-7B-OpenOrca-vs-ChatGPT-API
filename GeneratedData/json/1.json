{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve all records from a specific table."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN operations, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column3, table3.column4\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2\nJOIN table3 ON table2.column3 = table3.column4;\n```\n\nReplace \"table1\", \"table2\", and \"table3\" with the actual table names, and \"column1\", \"column2\", \"column3\", and \"column4\" with the actual column names in each table. This query will join the records from the three tables based on the specified conditions."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure!
