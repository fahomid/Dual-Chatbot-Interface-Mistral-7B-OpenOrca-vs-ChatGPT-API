{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN operations."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records from multiple tables using JOIN operations, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column3, table3.column4\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column2\nJOIN table3 ON table2.column3 = table3.column4;\n```\n\nReplace \"table1\", \"table2\", and \"table3\" with the actual table names, and \"column1\", \"column2\", \"column3\", and \"column4\" with the actual column names in each table. This query will join the records from the three tables based on the specified conditions."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query that retrieves records from multiple tables using JOIN operations:\n\n```sql\nSELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, products.product_name\nFROM orders\nJOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id\nJOIN order_details ON orders.order_id = order_details.order_id\nJOIN products ON order_details.product_id = products.product_id;\n```\n\nThis query retrieves the order ID, customer name, and product name for each order by joining the orders, customers, order_details, and products tables together based on their respective foreign keys."}}
