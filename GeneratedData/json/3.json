{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column does not equal a certain value."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records where a specific column does not equal a certain value, you can use the NOT IN or NOT EXISTS clause in SQL. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name NOT IN (value);\n```\n\nReplace \"table_name\" with the name of your table, \"column_name\" with the name of the column you want to check, and \"value\" with the value you want to compare against.\n\nFor example, if you have a table called \"users\" with a column called \"role\" and you want to retrieve all users who have a role that is not equal to \"admin\", you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nWHERE role NOT IN ('admin');\n```\n\nIf you want to check for multiple values, you can use the IN clause with the NOT keyword:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name NOT IN (value1, value2,...);\n```\n\nFor example, if you want to retrieve all users who have a role that is not equal to \"admin\" or \"moderator\", you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nWHERE role NOT IN ('admin','moderator');\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the NOT EXISTS clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM table_name AS t1\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM table_name AS t2\n    WHERE t1.column_name = t2.column_name AND t2.column_name = value\n);\n```\n\nReplace \"table_name\" with the name of your table, \"column_name\" with the name of the column you want to check, and \"value\" with the value you want to compare against.\n\nFor example, if you want to retrieve all users who have a role that is not equal to \"admin\", you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM users AS t1\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\n    SELECT 1\n    FROM users AS t2\n    WHERE t1.role = t2.role AND t2.role = 'admin'\n);\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the same result, but the NOT IN clause is generally faster and more efficient."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure, here is an example SQL query that retrieves records where the \"column_name\" does not equal a certain value \"specific_value\":\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table_name\nWHERE column_name <> 'specific_value';\n``` \n\nIn this query, replace \"table_name\" with the name of your table, \"column_name\" with the name of the specific column you want to check, and 'specific_value' with the value you want to exclude from the results."}}
