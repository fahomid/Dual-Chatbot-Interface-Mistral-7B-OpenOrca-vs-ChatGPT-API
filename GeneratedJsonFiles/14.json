{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records ordered by a specific column in ascending or descending order."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records ordered by a specific column in ascending or descending order, you can use the ORDER BY clause in your SQL query. Here's the general syntax:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_names\nFROM table_name\nORDER BY column_name ASC | DESC;\n```\n\nReplace \"column_names\" with the columns you want to retrieve, \"table_name\" with the table you want to query, and \"column_name\" with the column you want to order by. If you want the records ordered in ascending order, use \"ASC\"; if you want them ordered in descending order, use \"DESC\".\n\nFor example, if you want to retrieve records from the \"users\" table and order them by the \"age\" column in ascending order, your query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nORDER BY age ASC;\n```\n\nReplace \"users\" with the actual table name and \"age\" with the actual column name you want to order by."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records from a table called `employees` ordered by the column `salary` in descending order:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;\n```\n\nAnd here is an example SQL query to retrieve records from the same table ordered by the column `hire_date` in ascending order:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date ASC;\n```"}}
