{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column falls within a range of values."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records where a specific column falls within a range of values, you can use the BETWEEN keyword in your SQL query. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;\n```\n\nReplace \"table_name\" with the name of your table, \"column_name\" with the name of the column you want to filter, and \"value1\" and \"value2\" with the range of values you want to filter by."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where the \"price\" column falls within a range of values:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \nFROM table_name\nWHERE price BETWEEN 100 AND 200;\n``` \n\nIn this query, replace \"table_name\" with the name of your table and \"price\" with the name of the column you want to filter by. The BETWEEN operator is used to specify a range of values. In this case, it will retrieve records where the price is between 100 and 200."}}
