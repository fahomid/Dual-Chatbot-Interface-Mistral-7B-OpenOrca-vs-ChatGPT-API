{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records from a table based on a subquery."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records from a table based on a subquery, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_names\nFROM table_name\nWHERE condition = (\n    SELECT subquery_result\n    FROM subquery_table\n    WHERE subquery_condition\n)\n```\n\nReplace \"table_name\" with the actual table name, \"column_names\" with the desired columns, \"condition\" with the comparison operator (e.g., =, <>, >, <, etc.), and \"subquery_table\" and \"subquery_condition\" with the appropriate subquery and conditions."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records from a table based on a subquery:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \nFROM employees \nWHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id \n                        FROM departments \n                        WHERE location = 'New York');\n```\n\nIn this query, we are retrieving all records from the `employees` table where the `department_id` matches any `department_id` from the `departments` table that has a `location` value of 'New York'."}}
