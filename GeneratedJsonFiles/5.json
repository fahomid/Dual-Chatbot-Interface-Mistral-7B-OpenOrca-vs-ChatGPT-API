{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column is less than a certain value."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records where a specific column is less than a certain value, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name < value;\n```\n\nReplace \"table_name\" with the name of your table, \"column_name\" with the name of the column you want to compare, and \"value\" with the value you want to compare against."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column \"age\" is less than a certain value, let's say 30:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \nFROM your_table_name\nWHERE age < 30;\n```\n\nReplace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table and `age` with the column you want to filter by. This query will return all records where the value in the \"age\" column is less than 30."}}
