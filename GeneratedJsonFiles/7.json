{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column matches a pattern (using LIKE operator)."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To retrieve records where a specific column matches a pattern using the LIKE operator, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column_name\nFROM table_name\nWHERE column_name LIKE '%pattern%';\n```\n\nReplace 'column_name' with the name of the column you want to search, 'table_name' with the name of the table containing the column, and 'pattern' with the pattern you want to match. The '%' symbol is a wildcard that matches any sequence of characters."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Sure! Here is an example SQL query to retrieve records where a specific column (column_name) matches a pattern 'pattern':\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table_name\nWHERE column_name LIKE '%pattern%';\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `table_name` is the name of the table you want to query.\n- `column_name` is the name of the column you want to search for a pattern match.\n- `pattern` is the specific pattern you want to match in the column's values.\n\nThe `%` symbols are wildcards that represent zero, one, or multiple characters. So, `%pattern%` means the pattern can occur anywhere in the column's value. You can adjust the `%` symbols to match your specific pattern matching needs."}}
