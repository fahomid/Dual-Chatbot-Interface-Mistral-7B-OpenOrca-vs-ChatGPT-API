{"question":{"0":"Give me SQL query to delete records from a table based on certain conditions."},"mistral_response":{"0":" To delete records from a table based on certain conditions, you can use the DELETE statement in SQL. Here's a general example:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\nReplace \"table_name\" with the actual table name and \"condition\" with the specific conditions you want to apply to delete the records. For example, if you want to delete records where the \"column_name\" has a specific value, your query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM table_name\nWHERE column_name = value;\n```\n\nReplace \"column_name\" with the actual column name and \"value\" with the specific value you want to match. Make sure to test the query on a development or test environment before applying it to a production database to avoid unintended data loss."},"chatgpt_response":{"0":"Certainly! Here is an example SQL query to delete records from a table based on certain conditions:\n\n```sql\nDELETE FROM table_name\nWHERE condition_column = 'condition_value';\n```\n\nIn this query, replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to delete records from, `condition_column` with the column name on which you want to apply the condition, and `condition_value` with the value that needs to be matched for the records to be deleted. \n\nYou can also specify multiple conditions using logical operators such as `AND` or `OR` in the `WHERE` clause to delete records based on multiple conditions."}}
